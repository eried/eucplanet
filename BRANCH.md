# next-experimental

New features land here first. They work on the wheels they were written for
and may not work on yours yet, and settings can move between builds. Ride it
only when you can cut the ride short.

## Worked on

- Release builds are obfuscated (Play asks for it by Feb 2027). Branch APKs are debug builds and do not change.
- Navigator view: turn card, speed, arrival time and your own tiles on the map while navigating. Pick the tiles in Settings.
- Map: while navigating it faces where you ride (heading-up), turning on curves from the wheel's speed. Tap the compass for north-up.
- Map: zooms closer under 10 km/h, and near a turn keeps 15 s of road ahead in view.
- Map: Solve shortest route and Optimize stop order put the stops in the shortest riding order. Up to 49 stops.
- Map: a GPX track (Organic Maps, BRouter...) opens locked and is ridden as drawn, with cues from its bends. Convert to stops makes it editable.
- Map: Reverse route turns the stops round for the way back. Start far from a track rides you to its start first.
- Menus: options that cannot run grey out instead of disappearing, and delete rows are red with a bin.
- Android Auto: navigation on the car screen, with your four numbers beside it. Planned route rides a loaded track.
- HUD map: keeps working with the phone app in the background and no wheel connected. It now says when it is waiting for the phone GPS.
- HUD map: no more white "Map data not yet available" screen. Where the map has no detail that deep it shows the closest zoom it has.
- HUD camera: let go of the camera when you leave the Camera screen, so the MotoEye recorder can start.
- Voice alarms: a PWM alarm says "PWM" again in Italian, Norwegian and Chinese, it was left out.

## Please test

**Map / navigation**
- Navigate a 2-stop route in Full path and Next segment: turn card, arrival time, the next stop counting down and ticked off, End navigation?
- Heading-up: does the map face where you ride, also going south, on curves and slowly? Is the zoom right near turns?
- Load a GPX track and ride it: cues at real turns, named places announced? Convert to stops works?
- After arriving, Reverse route: does it take you back a sensible way?
- Landscape and north-up: everything readable and reachable?

**Android Auto** (install from the Play internal sharing link, a sideloaded APK never shows in the car)
- Navigate from the car screen: turn-by-turn shows, and your four numbers beside it?
- Load a GPX track on the phone, then Places, Planned route in the car: does it follow the track?

**HUD (MotoEye)**
- Install the phone and the HUD APK from this build. Open the HUD Map screen, leave the phone app, no wheel connected: does the map stay? And with the wheel connected, on any map style and zoom?
- Visit the Camera screen, go to another screen, then long press to start the MotoEye recorder: does it start every time?

## Reporting back

Open an issue with your wheel model and firmware (for Android Auto, the car
screen model and a photo). A Service Mode log beats a description; if it
crashed, Share crash log on the About screen.
